Coffee Counter
==============

Connect your freshpotbot-enabled Raspberry Pi (FreshPotBot repo coming soon) to this handy stat server.

## To use
Deploy to Heroku with a dev database.

To get coffee stats on demand install [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/) on Slack or your chosen chat system, and put the `coffeecounter_hubot.coffee` script in the scripts folder.
